    "Let’s start by looking at the `open() function`. To do any work with a file, even just printing its contents, you first need to open the file to access it. The `open()` function needs one argument: the name of the file you want to open. Python looks for this file in the directory where the program that is currently being executed is stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `open()` function returns an object representing the file. Here, `open(file_name)` returns an object representing `a_study_in_scarlet.txt`. Python stores this object in `file_object`, which we will work with later in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword `with` denotes a *Context Manager*, which essentially wraps a block of code and performs an action at the end of the block, no matter how it exits. In this case, it closes the file once access to it is no longer needed. Notice how we call `open()` in this program but not `close()`. You could open and close the file by calling `open()` and `close()`, but if a bug in your program prevents the `close()` statement from being executed, the file may never close. This may seem trivial, but improperly closed files can cause data to be lost or corrupted. And if you call `close()` too early in your program, you’ll find yourself trying to work with a closed file (a file you can’t access), which leads to more errors. It is not always easy to know exactly when you should close a file, but with the structure shown here, Python will figure that out for you. All you have to do is open the file and work with it as desired, trusting that Python will close it automatically when the time is right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a file object representing `a_study_in_scarlet.txt`, we use the `read()` method in the second line of our program to read the entire contents of the file and store it as one long string in contents. When we print the value of contents, we get the **entire** text file back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between this output and the original file is the extra blank line at the end of the output. The blank line appears because `read()` returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file; this empty string shows up as a blank line. If you want to remove the extra blank line, you can use `rstrip()`."

      "     country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in\n",
      "     the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in\n",
      "     safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new\n",
      "     duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\n",
      "     nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade\n",
      "     and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal\n",
      "     battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail\n",
      "     bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I\n",
      "     should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not\n",
      "     been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who\n",
      "     threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to\n",
      "     the British lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\n",
      "     undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\n",
      "     the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already\n",
      "     improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to\n",
      "     bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric\n",
      "     fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was\n",
      "     despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became\n",
      "     convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board\n",
      "     determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to\n",
      "     England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes, and\n",
      "     landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health\n",
      "     irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government\n",
      "     to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "     I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\n",
      "     air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day\n",
      "     will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally\n",
      "     gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers\n",
      "     and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for\n",
      "     some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless,\n",
      "     meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably\n",
      "     more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances\n",
      "     become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis\n",
      "     and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a\n",
      "     complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter\n",
      "     alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to\n",
      "     take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive\n",
      "     domicile.\n",

      "     On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\n",

      "     turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser\n",
      "     under me at Bart's. The sight of a friendly face in the great\n",
      "     wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In\n",

      "     I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be\n",
      "     delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to\n",

      "     flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over\n",
      "     a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he\n",
      "     glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \"I've\n",
      "     found it! I've found it,\" he shouted to my companion, running towards\n",
      "     us with a test-tube in his hand. \"I have found a re-agent which is\n",
      "     precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else.\" Had he discovered\n",
      "     a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said Stamford, introducing us.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"How are you?\" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength\n",
      "     for which I should hardly have given him credit. \"You have been in\n",

      "\n",

      "     discovery of mine?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\" I answered, \"but\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\n",
      "     Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.\n",
      "     Come over here now!\" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his\n",
      "     eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been\n",
      "     working. \"Let us have some fresh blood,\" he said, digging a long\n",
      "     bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood\n",
      "     in a chemical pipette. \"Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a\n",
      "     litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the\n",
      "     appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than\n",
      "     one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to\n",
      "     obtain the characteristic reaction.\" As he spoke, he threw into the\n",
      "     vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a\n",
      "     transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany\n",
      "     colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the\n",
      "     glass jar.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Ha! ha!\" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\n",
      "     child with a new toy. \"What do you think of that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"It seems to be a very delicate test,\" I remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\n",
      "     uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles.\n",
      "     The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this\n",
      "     appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test\n",
      "     been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who\n",
      "     would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\n",

      "     linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon\n",
      "     them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit\n",
      "     stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many\n",
      "     an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have\n",

      "\n",
      "     His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\n",

      "     imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You are to be congratulated,\" I remarked, considerably surprised at\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\n",

      "     as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar\n",

      "     221b, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\n",
      "     consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large\n",
      "     airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\n",
      "     windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so\n",
      "     moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain\n",
      "     was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.\n",
      "     That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\n",

      "     Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet\n",
      "     in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be\n",
      "     up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\n",
      "     before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the\n",
      "     chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and\n",
      "     occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the\n",
      "     lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the\n",
      "     working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize\n",
      "     him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the\n",
      "     sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning\n",
      "     to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant\n",
      "     expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being\n",
      "     addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and\n",
      "     cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\n",
      "\n",
      "     As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\n",

      "     and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\n",
      "     alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an\n",
      "     air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\n",
      "     squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\n",
      "     invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was\n",
      "     possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\n",

      "     himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\n",
      "     objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my\n",
      "     attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather\n",
      "     was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me\n",

      "     eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his\n",

      "     Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those\n",
      "     in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow\n",
      "     rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade,\n",
      "     and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a\n",
      "     young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour\n",
      "     or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor,\n",
      "     looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and\n",
      "     who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman. On another\n",
      "     occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my\n",
      "     companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform.\n",
      "     When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance,\n",
      "     Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I\n",
      "     would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to me for putting\n",
      "     me to this inconvenience. \"I have to use this room as a place of\n",

      "     delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I\n",
      "     imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding\n",
      "     to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject\n",

      "\n",
      "     It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that\n",
      "     I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes\n",
      "     had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so\n",
      "     accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my\n",
      "     coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang\n",
      "     the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked\n",
      "     up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time\n",
      "     with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the\n",
      "     articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to\n",
      "     run my eye through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Its somewhat ambitious title was \"The Book of Life,\" and it attempted\n",
      "     to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and\n",
      "     systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as\n",
      "     being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The\n",
      "     reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to\n",
      "     be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary\n",
      "     expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a\n",
      "     man's inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility\n",
      "     in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His\n",
      "     conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So\n",
      "     startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they\n",
      "     learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well\n",
      "     consider him as a necromancer.\n",

      "     of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of\n",
      "     which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all\n",
      "     other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can\n",
      "     only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to\n",
      "     allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it.\n",
      "     Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which\n",
      "     present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by\n",
      "     mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a\n",
      "     fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the\n",
      "     man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such\n",
      "     an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and\n",
      "     teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man's finger\n",
      "     nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the\n",
      "     callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his\n",
      "     shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man's calling is plainly\n",
      "     revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent\n",

      "     private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I\n",
      "     manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence\n",
      "     before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of\n",
      "     the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family\n",

      "     about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and\n",
      "     an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\n",

      "     Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It\n",
      "     was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two\n",
      "     being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers\n",
      "     of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that\n",
      "     here and there a \"To Let\" card had developed like a cataract upon the\n",
      "     bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered\n",
      "     eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the\n",
      "     street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour,\n",
      "     and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The\n",
      "     whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through\n",
      "     the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a\n",
      "     fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning\n",
      "     a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers,\n",
      "     who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of\n",
      "     catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.\n",
      "\n",
      "     I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into\n",
      "     the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared\n",
      "     to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which,\n",
      "     under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he\n",
      "     lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground,\n",
      "     the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having\n",
      "     finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather\n",
      "     down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes\n",
      "     riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile,\n",
      "     and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many\n",
      "     marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had\n",
      "     been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion\n",
      "     could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such\n",
      "     extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties,\n",
      "     that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden\n",
      "     from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "     At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\n",
      "     flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward\n",
      "     and wrung my companion's hand with effusion. \"It is indeed kind of\n",
      "     you to come,\" he said, \"I have had everything left untouched.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Except that!\" my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \"If a\n",
      "     herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess.\n",
      "     No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson,\n",
      "     before you permitted this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I have had so much to do inside the house,\" the detective said\n",
      "     evasively. \"My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon\n",
      "     him to look after this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \"With two\n",
      "     such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\n",
      "     much for a third party to find out,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \"I think we have\n",
      "     done all that can be done,\" he answered; \"it's a queer case though,\n",
      "     and I knew your taste for such things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You did not come here in a cab?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Then let us go and look at the room.\" With which inconsequent remark\n",
      "     he strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features\n",
      "     expressed his astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "     A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and\n",
      "     offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One\n",
      "     of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged\n",
      "     to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious\n",
      "     affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that\n",
      "     subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.\n",
      "\n",
      "     It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence\n",
      "     of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it\n",
      "     was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips\n",
      "     had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster\n",
      "     beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a\n",
      "     mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was\n",
      "     stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty\n",
      "     that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to\n",
      "     everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which\n",
      "     coated the whole apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "     All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\n",
      "     centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched\n",
      "     upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the\n",
      "     discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or\n",
      "     forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp\n",
      "     curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a\n",
      "     heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured\n",
      "     trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed\n",
      "     and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were\n",
      "     clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were\n",
      "     interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On\n",
      "     his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed\n",
      "     to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This\n",
      "     malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead,\n",
      "     blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly\n",
      "     simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,\n",
      "     unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it\n",
      "     appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\n",
      "     apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\n",
      "     London.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway,\n",
      "     and greeted my companion and myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"This case will make a stir, sir,\" he remarked. \"It beats anything I\n",
      "     have seen, and I am no chicken.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"There is no clue?\" said Gregson.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"None at all,\" chimed in Lestrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\n",
      "     intently. \"You are sure that there is no wound?\" he asked, pointing\n",
      "     to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Positive!\" cried both detectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second\n",
      "     individual--presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It\n",
      "     reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen,\n",
      "     in Utrecht, in the year '34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"No, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun.\n",
      "     It has all been done before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and\n",
      "     everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes\n",
      "     wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.\n",
      "     So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have\n",
      "     guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he\n",
      "     sniffed the dead man's lips, and then glanced at the soles of his\n",
      "     patent leather boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"He has not been moved at all?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You can take him to the mortuary now,\" he said. \"There is nothing\n",
      "     more to be learned.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they\n",
      "     entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As\n",
      "     they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor.\n",
      "     Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"There's been a woman here,\" he cried. \"It's a woman's wedding-ring.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all\n",
      "     gathered round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that\n",
      "     circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"This complicates matters,\" said Gregson. \"Heaven knows, they were\n",
      "     complicated enough before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You're sure it doesn't simplify them?\" observed Holmes. \"There's\n",
      "     nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\n",
      "     pockets?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "     long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take\n",

      "     with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had\n",
      "     no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep\n",
      "     impression must have been there during the night. There were the\n",
      "     marks of the horse's hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far\n",
      "     more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was\n",
      "     a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not\n",
      "     there at any time during the morning--I have Gregson's word for\n",
      "     that--it follows that it must have been there during the night, and,\n",

      "\n",
      "     Our morning's exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I\n",
      "     was tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes' departure for the\n",
      "     concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of\n",
      "     hours' sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much\n",
      "     excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and\n",
      "     surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw\n",
      "     before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man.\n",
      "     So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me\n",
      "     that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who\n",
      "     had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke\n",
      "     vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch\n",
      "     J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be\n",
      "     done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the\n",
      "     eyes of the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion's\n",
      "     hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how\n",
      "     he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected\n",
      "     something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not\n",
      "     poison, what had caused the man's death, since there was neither\n",
      "     wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood\n",
      "     was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of\n",
      "     a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have\n",
      "     wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved,\n",
      "     I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or\n",
      "     myself. His quiet self-confident manner convinced me that he had\n",

      "     the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to.\n",
      "     There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it will be\n",
      "     some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13 we found\n",
      "     that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named Keswick,\n",
      "     and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been\n",
      "     heard of there.\"\n",

      "     inimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this\n",

      "     seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\n",
      "     name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\n",
      "     inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\n",
      "     refugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\n",
      "     America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten\n",
      "     laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the\n",

      "     the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff\n",
      "     Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government\n",
      "     and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The Standard commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the\n",
      "     sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from\n",
      "     the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent\n",
      "     weakening of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman\n",
      "     who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed\n",
      "     at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace,\n",
      "     Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels by his private\n",
      "     secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to their\n",
      "     landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station\n",
      "     with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express. They\n",
      "     were afterwards seen together upon the platform. Nothing more is\n",
      "     known of them until Mr. Drebber's body was, as recorded, discovered\n",
      "     in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How he\n",
      "     came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still\n",

      "     of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is\n",
      "     confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\n",
      "     throw light upon the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The Daily News observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\n",
      "     a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which\n",
      "     animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to\n",
      "     our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens\n",
      "     were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had\n",
      "     undergone. Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any\n",
      "     infringement of which was punished by death. Every effort should be\n",
      "     made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some\n",
      "     particulars of the habits of the deceased. A great step had been\n",
      "     gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are\n",

      "\n",
      "     He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"My dear fellow,\" he cried, wringing Holmes' unresponsive hand,\n",

      "\n",
      "     A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion's expressive\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"I don't mind if I do,\" the detective answered. \"The tremendous\n",
      "     exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have\n",
      "     worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the\n",
      "     strain upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\n",
      "     for we are both brain-workers.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "     The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"The fun of it is,\" he cried, \"that that fool Lestrade, who thinks\n",

      "     \"Ah, I'll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is\n",
      "     strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to\n",
      "     contend with was the finding of this American's antecedents. Some\n",
      "     people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or\n",
      "     until parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of\n",
      "     that size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it\n",
      "     at once. He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at\n",

      "     the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The\n",
      "     night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the\n",

      "     Jove, here's the very man himself!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were\n",

      "     which generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however,\n",
      "     wanting. His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were\n",
      "     disarranged and untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of\n",

      "     appeared to be embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the\n",

      "     employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become\n",
      "     of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description\n",

      "     have known that before ever I saw the box at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\n",
      "     hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead\n",
      "     dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It\n",
      "     seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing\n",
      "     away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"All this seems strange to you,\" continued Holmes, \"because you\n",
      "     failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the\n",
      "     single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune\n",
      "     to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has\n",
      "     served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the\n",
      "     logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and\n",
      "     made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to\n",
      "     strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness\n",
      "     with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious\n",
      "     because it presents no new or special features from which deductions\n",
      "     may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult\n",
      "     to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the\n",
      "     roadway without any of those outré and sensational accompaniments\n",
      "     which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from\n",
      "     making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making\n",
      "     it less so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\n",
      "     impatience, could contain himself no longer. \"Look here, Mr. Sherlock\n",
      "     Holmes,\" he said, \"we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a\n",
      "     smart man, and that you have your own methods of working. We want\n",
      "     something more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a\n",
      "     case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was\n",
      "     wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second\n",
      "     affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that\n",
      "     he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there,\n",
      "     and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel\n",
      "     that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the\n",
      "     business. Can you name the man who did it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\" remarked\n",
      "     Lestrade. \"We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have\n",
      "     remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had\n",
      "     all the evidence which you require. Surely you will not withhold it\n",
      "     any longer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Any delay in arresting the assassin,\" I observed, \"might give him\n",
      "     time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\n",
      "     continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his\n",
      "     chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in\n",
      "     thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"There will be no more murders,\" he said at last, stopping abruptly\n",
      "     and facing us. \"You can put that consideration out of the question.\n",
      "     You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere\n",
      "     knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the\n",
      "     power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do.\n",
      "     I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it\n",
      "     is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and\n",
      "     desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion\n",
      "     to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man\n",
      "     has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of\n",
      "     securing him; but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change\n",
      "     his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants\n",
      "     of this great city. Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings,\n",
      "     I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match\n",
      "     for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your\n",
      "     assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to\n",
      "     this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to\n",
      "     promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without\n",
      "     endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this\n",
      "     assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police.\n",
      "     The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the\n",
      "     other's beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither\n",
      "     of them had time to speak, however, before there was a tap at the\n",
      "     door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins,\n",
      "     introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Please, sir,\" he said, touching his forelock, \"I have the cab\n",
      "     downstairs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Good boy,\" said Holmes, blandly. \"Why don't you introduce this\n",
      "     pattern at Scotland Yard?\" he continued, taking a pair of steel\n",
      "     handcuffs from a drawer. \"See how beautifully the spring works. They\n",
      "     fasten in an instant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"The old pattern is good enough,\" remarked Lestrade, \"if we can only\n",
      "     find the man to put them on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Very good, very good,\" said Holmes, smiling. \"The cabman may as well\n",
      "     help me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\n",
      "     to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about\n",
      "     it. There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out\n",
      "     and began to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman\n",
      "     entered the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\" he said, kneeling\n",
      "     over his task, and never turning his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\n",
      "     down his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click,\n",
      "     the jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, with flashing eyes, \"let me introduce you to\n",
      "     Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph\n",
      "     Stangerson.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     The whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no time\n",
      "     to realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of\n",
      "     Holmes' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the\n",
      "     cabman's dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering\n",
      "     handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a\n",
      "     second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then, with an\n",
      "     inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from\n",
      "     Holmes's grasp, and hurled himself through the window. Woodwork and\n",
      "     glass gave way before him; but before he got quite through, Gregson,\n",
      "     Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was\n",
      "     dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict.\n",
      "     So powerful and so fierce was he, that the four of us were shaken off\n",
      "     again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man\n",
      "     in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly mangled by his\n",
      "     passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in\n",
      "     diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in\n",
      "     getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we\n",
      "     made him realize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then\n",
      "     we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his\n",
      "     hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "     In the central portion of the great North American Continent there\n",
      "     lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served\n",
      "     as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra\n",
      "     Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to\n",
      "     the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence.\n",
      "     Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It\n",
      "     comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy\n",
      "     valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged\n",
      "     cañons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with\n",
      "     snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all\n",
      "     preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness,\n",
      "     inhospitality, and misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "     There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees\n",
      "     or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\n",
      "     hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose\n",
      "     sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon\n",
      "     their prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps\n",
      "     heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through\n",
      "     the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the\n",
      "     rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\n",
      "\n",
      "     In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from\n",
      "     the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\n",
      "     stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\n",
      "     alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes.\n",
      "     On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain\n",
      "     peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great\n",
      "     stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything\n",
      "     appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no\n",
      "     movement upon the dull, grey earth--above all, there is absolute\n",
      "     silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that\n",
      "     mighty wilderness; nothing but silence--complete and heart-subduing\n",
      "     silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "     It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\n",
      "     plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\n",
      "     sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\n",
      "     lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden\n",
      "     down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are\n",
      "     scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out\n",
      "     against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They\n",
      "     are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate.\n",
      "     The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen\n",
      "     hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these\n",
      "     scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\n",
      "     eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His\n",
      "     appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon\n",
      "     of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say\n",
      "     whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and\n",
      "     haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the\n",
      "     projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and\n",
      "     dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with\n",
      "     an unnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was\n",
      "     hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned\n",
      "     upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive\n",
      "     framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution.\n",
      "     His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over\n",
      "     his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that\n",
      "     senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying--dying from hunger\n",
      "     and from thirst.\n",
      "\n",
      "     He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\n",
      "     elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the\n",
      "     great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of\n",
      "     savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which\n",
      "     might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape\n",
      "     there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with\n",
      "     wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had\n",
      "     come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to\n",
      "     die. \"Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\"\n",
      "     he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless\n",
      "     rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had\n",
      "     carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too\n",
      "     heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the\n",
      "     ground with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey\n",
      "     parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small,\n",
      "     scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled,\n",
      "     dimpled fists.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You've hurt me!\" said a childish voice reproachfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Have I though,\" the man answered penitently, \"I didn't go for to do\n",
      "     it.\" As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\n",
      "     little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\n",
      "     pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother's care.\n",
      "     The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that\n",
      "     she had suffered less than her companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"How is it now?\" he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\n",
      "     towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Kiss it and make it well,\" she said, with perfect gravity, shoving\n",
      "     the injured part up to him. \"That's what mother used to do. Where's\n",
      "     mother?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Mother's gone. I guess you'll see her before long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Gone, eh!\" said the little girl. \"Funny, she didn't say good-bye;\n",
      "     she 'most always did if she was just goin' over to Auntie's for tea,\n",
      "     and now she's been away three days. Say, it's awful dry, ain't it?\n",
      "     Ain't there no water, nor nothing to eat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"No, there ain't nothing, dearie. You'll just need to be patient\n",
      "     awhile, and then you'll be all right. Put your head up agin me like\n",

      "     lips is like leather, but I guess I'd best let you know how the cards\n",
      "     lie. What's that you've got?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Pretty things! fine things!\" cried the little girl enthusiastically,\n",
      "     holding up two glittering fragments of mica. \"When we goes back to\n",
      "     home I'll give them to brother Bob.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You'll see prettier things than them soon,\" said the man\n",
      "     confidently. \"You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you\n",
      "     though--you remember when we left the river?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Oh, yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Well, we reckoned we'd strike another river soon, d'ye see. But\n",
      "     there was somethin' wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin', and it\n",
      "     didn't turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the\n",
      "     likes of you and--and--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"And you couldn't wash yourself,\" interrupted his companion gravely,\n",
      "     staring up at his grimy visage.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then\n",
      "     Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then,\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Then mother's a deader too,\" cried the little girl dropping her face\n",
      "     in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\n",

      "     and we tramped it together. It don't seem as though we've improved\n",
      "     matters. There's an almighty small chance for us now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Do you mean that we are going to die too?\" asked the child, checking\n",
      "     her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I guess that's about the size of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Why didn't you say so before?\" she said, laughing gleefully. \"You\n",

      "     in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange\n",
      "     contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the\n",

      "     Three weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had\n",
      "     departed from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier's heart was sore within\n",
      "     him when he thought of the young man's return, and of the impending\n",
      "     loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled\n",
      "     him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had\n",
      "     always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing\n",
      "     would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a\n",
      "     marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a\n",
      "     disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that\n",
      "     one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject,\n",
      "     however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter\n",
      "     in those days in the Land of the Saints.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Yes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly\n",
      "     dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest\n",
      "     something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring\n",
      "     down a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had\n",
      "     now turned persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the\n",
      "     most terrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the\n",
      "     German Vehmgericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able\n",
      "     to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a\n",
      "     cloud over the State of Utah.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this\n",
      "     organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\n",
      "     omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\n",
      "     against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone\n",
      "     or what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at\n",
      "     home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at\n",
      "     the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was\n",
      "     followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be\n",
      "     of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that\n",
      "     men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of\n",
      "     the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed\n",
      "     them.\n",
      "\n",
      "     At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\n",
      "     recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished\n",
      "     afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a\n",
      "     wider range. The supply of adult women was running short, and\n",
      "     polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren\n",
      "     doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied about--rumours\n",
      "     of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had\n",
      "     never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the\n",
      "     Elders--women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the\n",
      "     traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the\n",
      "     mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and\n",
      "     noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These tales and\n",
      "     rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\n",
      "     re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\n",
      "     To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the\n",
      "     Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened\n",
      "     one.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\n",
      "     results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\n",
      "     inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\n",
      "     society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\n",
      "     violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\n",
      "     The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\n",

      "     at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence\n",

      "     starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"And how have I neglected it?\" asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands\n",

      "     \"It is true that I have not married,\" Ferrier answered. \"But women\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been\n",

      "     would not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of\n",
      "     all choice. We Elders have many heifers*1, but our children must also\n",

      "     On the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,\n",

      "     acquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted\n",
      "     him with his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man\n",
      "     of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it\n",
      "     was that he should return. Having done thus he felt easier in his\n",
      "     mind, and returned home with a lighter heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "     As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\n",
      "     each of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on\n",
      "     entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room.\n",
      "     One, with a long pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair,\n",
      "     with his feet cocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked\n",
      "     youth with coarse bloated features, was standing in front of the\n",
      "     window with his hands in his pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both\n",
      "     of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the\n",
      "     rocking-chair commenced the conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Maybe you don't know us,\" he said. \"This here is the son of Elder\n",
      "     Drebber, and I'm Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the\n",
      "     desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"As He will all the nations in His own good time,\" said the other in\n",

      "\n",
      "     John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"We have come,\" continued Stangerson, \"at the advice of our fathers\n",
      "     to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem\n",
      "     good to you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber\n",
      "     here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\" cried the other; \"the question is not\n",
      "     how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\n",
      "     given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"But my prospects are better,\" said the other, warmly. \"When the Lord\n",
      "     removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\n",
      "     factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"It will be for the maiden to decide,\" rejoined young Drebber,\n",
      "     smirking at his own reflection in the glass. \"We will leave it all to\n",
      "     her decision.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\n",
      "     hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two\n",
      "     visitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Look here,\" he said at last, striding up to them, \"when my daughter\n",

      "\n",
      "     His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,\n",
      "     that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat.\n",
      "     The old farmer followed them to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,\" he said,\n",
      "     sardonically.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You shall smart for this!\" Stangerson cried, white with rage. \"You\n",
      "     have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to\n",
      "     the end of your days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\" cried young Drebber;\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Then I'll start the smiting,\" exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would\n",
      "     have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm\n",
      "     and restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of\n",
      "     horses' hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"The young canting rascals!\" he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration\n",
      "     from his forehead; \"I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl,\n",
      "     than the wife of either of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"And so should I, father,\" she answered, with spirit; \"but Jefferson\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for\n",
      "     we do not know what their next move may be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\n",
      "     help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\n",
      "     daughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\n",
      "     such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\n",
      "     minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\n",
      "     arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\n",
      "     avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\n",
      "     spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church.\n",
      "     He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors\n",
      "     which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip,\n",
      "     but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his\n",
      "     daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter,\n",
      "     though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at\n",
      "     ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "     He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\n",
      "     Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in\n",
      "     an unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his\n",
      "     surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his\n",
      "     bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling\n",
      "     letters:--\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\n",
      "     this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\n",
      "     servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\n",
      "     secured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter,\n",
      "     but the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days\n",
      "     were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised.\n",
      "     What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\n",
      "     mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\n",
      "     him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\n",
      "     breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\n",
      "     centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently,\n",
      "     the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\n",
      "     enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\n",
      "     ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27\n",
      "     had been painted upon the outside of his door.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\n",
      "     unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\n",
      "     conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\n",
      "     month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\n",
      "     sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\n",
      "     stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance\n",
      "     John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings\n",
      "     proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at\n",
      "     the sight of them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had\n",
      "     the troubled look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in\n",
      "     life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from\n",
      "     Nevada.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no\n",
      "     news of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still\n",
      "     there came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the\n",
      "     road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the\n",
      "     gate thinking that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw\n",
      "     five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and\n",
      "     abandoned all hope of escape. Single-handed, and with his limited\n",
      "     knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew\n",
      "     that he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly\n",
      "     watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order\n",
      "     from the Council. Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no\n",
      "     avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered\n",
      "     in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to\n",
      "     what he regarded as his daughter's dishonour.\n",
      "\n",
      "     He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles,\n",
      "     and searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown\n",
      "     the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be\n",
      "     the last of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of\n",
      "     vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his\n",
      "     daughter--what was to become of her after he was gone? Was there no\n",
      "     escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He\n",
      "     sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own\n",
      "     impotence.\n",
      "\n",
      "     What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching\n",
      "     sound--low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from\n",
      "     the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened\n",
      "     intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low\n",
      "     insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very\n",
      "     gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight\n",
      "     assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret\n",
      "     tribunal? Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day\n",
      "     of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be\n",
      "     better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his\n",
      "     heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars\n",
      "     were twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before\n",
      "     the farmer's eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there\n",
      "     nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of\n",
      "     relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to\n",
      "     glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man\n",
      "     lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all\n",
      "     asprawl.\n",
      "\n",
      "     So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall\n",
      "     with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out.\n",
      "     His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some\n",
      "     wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the\n",
      "     ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a\n",
      "     serpent. Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the\n",
      "     door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and\n",
      "     resolute expression of Jefferson Hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Good God!\" gasped John Ferrier. \"How you scared me! Whatever made\n",
      "     you come in like that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Give me food,\" the other said, hoarsely. \"I have had no time for\n",
      "     bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours.\" He flung himself upon the\n",
      "     cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his\n",
      "     host's supper, and devoured it voraciously. \"Does Lucy bear up well?\"\n",
      "     he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Yes. She does not know the danger,\" her father answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I\n",
      "     crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they're not\n",
      "     quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a\n",
      "     devoted ally. He seized the young man's leathery hand and wrung it\n",
      "     cordially. \"You're a man to be proud of,\" he said. \"There are not\n",
      "     many who would come to share our danger and our troubles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You've hit it there, pard,\" the young hunter answered. \"I have a\n",
      "     respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I'd think\n",
      "     twice before I put my head into such a hornet's nest. It's Lucy that\n",
      "     brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be\n",
      "     one less o' the Hope family in Utah.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"What are we to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are\n",
      "     lost. I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How\n",
      "     much money have you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "     between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious,\n",
      "     and there was much to be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"We must make our start at once,\" said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a\n",
      "     low but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the\n",
      "     peril, but has steeled his heart to meet it. \"The front and back\n",
      "     entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the\n",
      "     side window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two\n",

      "     them with us,\" he said with a sinister smile.\n",

      "     The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\n",
      "     darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his\n",
      "     own, and which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long\n",
      "     nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the\n",
      "     honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his\n",
      "     ruined fortunes. All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees\n",
      "     and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to\n",
      "     realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the\n",

      "     the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden.\n",
      "     With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and\n",
      "     gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came\n",
      "     to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached\n",

      "     of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small\n",

      "     but Hope's intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain\n",
      "     the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though\n",

      "     snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other's shoulders\n",
      "     to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of\n",
      "     them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their\n",
      "     heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon\n",
      "     them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley\n",
      "     was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a\n",
      "     similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering\n",
      "     down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges,\n",
      "     and startled the weary horses into a gallop.\n",
      "\n",
      "     As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the\n",
      "     great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival,\n",
      "     until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle\n",
      "     cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy.\n",
      "     At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and\n",
      "     watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy\n",
      "     and her father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was\n",
      "     inexorable. \"They will be upon our track by this time,\" he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "     During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles,\n",
      "     and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles\n",
      "     from their enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling\n",
      "     crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind,\n",
      "     and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours'\n",

      "     more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope\n",
      "     began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible\n",
      "     organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far\n",
      "     that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them\n",
      "     and crush them.\n",
      "\n",
      "     About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\n",
      "     of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little\n",
      "     uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the\n",
      "     mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle\n",
      "     for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a\n",
      "     few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions\n",
      "     might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet\n",
      "     above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered\n",
      "     the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder,\n",
      "     and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way.\n",
      "     Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the\n",
      "     blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the\n",
      "     back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view.\n",
      "\n",
      "     He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another\n",
      "     without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees,\n",
      "     and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in\n",
      "     the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours' fruitless search, he\n",
      "     was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes\n",
      "     upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his\n",
      "     heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet\n",
      "     above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in\n",
      "     appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The\n",
      "     big-horn--for so it is called--was acting, probably, as a guardian\n",
      "     over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it\n",
      "     was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him.\n",
      "     Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long\n",
      "     and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the\n",
      "     air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then\n",
      "     came crashing down into the valley beneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented\n",
      "     himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this\n",
      "     trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the\n",
      "     evening was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however,\n",
      "     before he realized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness\n",
      "     he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it\n",
      "     was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The\n",
      "     valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many\n",
      "     gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to\n",
      "     distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more\n",
      "     until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had\n",
      "     never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he\n",
      "     tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly,\n",
      "     and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile\n",
      "     which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to\n",
      "     the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs\n",
      "     on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with\n",
      "     his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping\n",
      "     up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to\n",
      "     Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the\n",
      "     remainder of their journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "     He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\n",
      "     them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the\n",
      "     cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him\n",
      "     anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness\n",
      "     of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo\n",
      "     to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and\n",
      "     listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered\n",
      "     up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in\n",
      "     countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and\n",
      "     again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a\n",
      "     short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried\n",
      "     onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "     When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where\n",
      "     the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes\n",
      "     there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The\n",
      "     same dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed\n",
      "     to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\n",
      "     remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\n",
      "     too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\n",
      "     his absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left\n",
      "     no traces behind it.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head\n",
      "     spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from\n",
      "     falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily\n",
      "     recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece\n",
      "     of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and\n",
      "     proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was\n",
      "     all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of\n",
      "     mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their\n",
      "     tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City.\n",
      "     Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson\n",
      "     Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when\n",
      "     his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle\n",
      "     within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap\n",
      "     of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was\n",
      "     no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the young\n",
      "     hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on\n",
      "     it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The\n",
      "     inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:\n",

      "     wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no\n",
      "     sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to\n",
      "     fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the\n",
      "     Elder's son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate,\n",
      "     and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was\n",

      "\n",
      "     Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which\n",
      "     springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could\n",
      "     at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and\n",
      "     perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained\n",
      "     vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst\n",
      "     whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the\n",
      "     only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and\n",
      "     complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His\n",
      "     strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to\n",
      "     that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where\n",
      "     he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire,\n",
      "     he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a\n",

      "\n",
      "     For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which\n",
      "     he had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down\n",
      "     among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before\n",
      "     daybreak he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached\n",

      "     fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at\n",
      "     it, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal\n",

      "     what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse's hoofs, and\n",

      "     him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at\n",
      "     different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him,\n",
      "     with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier's fate had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I am Jefferson Hope,\" he said. \"You remember me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment--indeed, it\n",
      "     was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with\n",
      "     ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of\n",
      "     former days. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his\n",
      "     identity, the man's surprise changed to consternation.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You are mad to come here,\" he cried. \"It is as much as my own life\n",
      "     is worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you\n",
      "     from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"I don't fear them, or their warrant,\" Hope said, earnestly. \"You\n",
      "     must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by\n",
      "     everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always\n",
      "     been friends. For God's sake, don't refuse to answer me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"What is it?\" the Mormon asked uneasily. \"Be quick. The very rocks\n",
      "     have ears and the trees eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"What has become of Lucy Ferrier?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up,\n",
      "     you have no life left in you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Don't mind me,\" said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips,\n",
      "     and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning.\n",
      "     \"Married, you say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Married yesterday--that's what those flags are for on the Endowment\n",
      "     House. There was some words between young Drebber and young\n",
      "     Stangerson as to which was to have her. They'd both been in the party\n",
      "     that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed\n",
      "     to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council,\n",
      "     Drebber's party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to\n",
      "     him. No one won't have her very long though, for I saw death in her\n",
      "     face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off,\n",
      "     then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Yes, I am off,\" said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat.\n",
      "     His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was\n",
      "     its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Where are you going?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Never mind,\" he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his\n",
      "     shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the\n",
      "     mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there\n",
      "     was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it\n",
      "     was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful\n",
      "     marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her\n",
      "     head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish\n",
      "     husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John\n",
      "     Ferrier's property, did not affect any great grief at his\n",
      "     bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with\n",
      "     her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were\n",
      "     grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to\n",
      "     their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open,\n",
      "     and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode\n",
      "     into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he\n",
      "     walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the\n",
      "     pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips\n",
      "     reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he\n",
      "     took the wedding-ring from her finger. \"She shall not be buried in\n",
      "     that,\" he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be\n",
      "     raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief\n",
      "     was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to\n",
      "     believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been\n",
      "     for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as\n",
      "     having been a bride had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "     For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading\n",
      "     a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\n",
      "     vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the\n",
      "     weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which\n",
      "     haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through\n",
      "     Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot\n",
      "     of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great\n",
      "     boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by\n",
      "     throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long\n",
      "     in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\n",
      "     repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\n",
      "     killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted\n",
      "     the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of\n",
      "     having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax\n",
      "     these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their\n",
      "     opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter's\n",
      "     mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of\n",
      "     revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no\n",
      "     room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things\n",
      "     practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not\n",
      "     stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and\n",
      "     want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog\n",
      "     among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet\n",
      "     such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that\n",
      "     that was to play his enemy's game, so he reluctantly returned to the\n",
      "     old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money\n",
      "     enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation.\n",
      "\n",
      "     His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\n",
      "     combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the\n",
      "     mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory\n",
      "     of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on\n",
      "     that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave.\n",
      "     Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City,\n",
      "     careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he\n",
      "     knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There\n",
      "     had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some\n",
      "     of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the\n",
      "     authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a\n",
      "     certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become\n",
      "     Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one\n",
      "     knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed\n",
      "     to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had\n",
      "     departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was\n",
      "     comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their\n",
      "     whereabouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\n",
      "     revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\n",
      "     faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked\n",
      "     out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to\n",
      "     town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed\n",
      "     into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on,\n",
      "     a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon\n",
      "     which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded.\n",
      "     It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told\n",
      "     him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit\n",
      "     of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance\n",
      "     all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his\n",
      "     window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder\n",
      "     in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\n",
      "     Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to\n",
      "     him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and\n",
      "     hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into\n",
      "     custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some\n",
      "     weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that\n",
      "     Drebber's house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had\n",
      "     departed for Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\n",
      "     urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and\n",
      "     for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\n",
      "     approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\n",
      "     him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to\n",
      "     city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking\n",
      "     the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for\n",
      "     Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just\n",
      "     set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days\n",
      "     late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded\n",
      "     in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do\n",
      "     better than quote the old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in\n",

      "\n",
      "     Our prisoner's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any\n",
      "     ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself\n",
      "     powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes\n",
      "     that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. \"I guess you're going\n",
      "     to take me to the police-station,\" he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "     \"My cab's at the door. If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it.\n",

      "     Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this\n",

      "     at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his\n",
      "     ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself\n",
      "     that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself,\n",
      "     as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man;\n",
      "     and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and\n",
      "     energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you\n",
      "     are the man for it,\" he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at\n",
      "     my fellow-lodger. \"The way you kept on my trail was a caution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"You had better come with me,\" said Holmes to the two detectives.\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have\n",

      "\n",
      "     I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made\n",
      "     no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been\n",
      "     his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the\n",
      "     horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We\n",
      "     were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down\n",
      "     our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had\n",
      "     been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who\n",
      "     went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. \"The prisoner will\n",
      "     be put before the magistrates in the course of the week,\" he said;\n",
      "     \"in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you\n",

      "     \"I may never be tried,\" he answered. \"You needn't look startled. It\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"I'll sit down, with your leave,\" the prisoner said, suiting the\n",

      "     manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace\n",
      "     enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I\n",
      "     have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"It don't much matter to you why I hated these men,\" he said; \"it's\n",

      "     father and a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their\n",
      "     own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime,\n",
      "     it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any\n",
      "     court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should\n",
      "     be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done\n",

      "     that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his\n",
      "     last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I\n",
      "     have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his\n",
      "     accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to\n",
      "     tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is\n",
      "     likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and\n",

      "     to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I\n",
      "     found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving\n",
      "     and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a\n",
      "     cabowner's office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain\n",

      "     myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along\n",

      "     reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that\n",
      "     he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it\n",

      "     \"The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\n",

      "     returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a\n",

      "     he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was\n",
      "     a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so\n",
      "     close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the\n",

      "     inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men\n",
      "     appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap\n",
      "     whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar,\n",
      "     and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a\n",

      "     cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his\n",
      "     legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing\n",
      "     my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. 'Drive me to Halliday's Private\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy\n",

      "     when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him\n",
      "     again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in,\n",
      "     leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until\n",

      "     some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some\n",
      "     South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least\n",
      "     grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this\n",
      "     preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to\n",
      "     a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this\n",
      "     alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with\n",
      "     a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that\n",
      "     when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one\n",
      "     of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite\n",
      "     as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a\n",
      "     handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me,\n",
      "     and the time had now come when I was to use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\n",

      "     it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples\n",
      "     throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier\n",
      "     and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me,\n",
      "     just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were\n",

      "     of it. I don't know what it was that put it into my head to write\n",
      "     upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of\n",
      "     setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and\n",
      "     cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE\n",
      "     written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers\n",
      "     that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what\n",

      "     distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept\n",
      "     Lucy's ring, and found that it was not there. I was thunderstruck at\n",
      "     this, for it was the only memento that I had of her. Thinking that I\n",
      "     might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber's body, I drove\n",
      "     back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the\n",

      "     could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I\n",

      "     its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science\n",
      "     which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing\n",
      "     footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much\n",
      "     practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks\n",
      "     of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had\n",
      "     first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had\n",
      "     been before the others, because in places their marks had been\n",
      "     entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In\n",
      "     this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal\n",
      "     visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I\n",
      "     calculated from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably\n",
      "     dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his\n",

      "\n",
      "     \"On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My\n",

      "     murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man's\n",
      "     person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he\n",
      "     had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart\n",
      "     disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit\n",
      "     agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man's lips I\n",
      "     detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he\n",
      "     had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been\n",
      "     forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By\n",
      "     the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other\n",

      "     politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which\n",

      "     and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most\n",
      "     deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the\n",
      "     room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been\n",

      "     I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too\n",
      "     evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the\n",
      "     question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of\n",
      "     some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson\n",
      "     whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any\n",

      "     me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the\n",
      "     length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since\n",
      "     there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the\n",

    "# Writing to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest ways to save data is to write it to a file. When you write text to a file, the output will still be available after you close the terminal containing your program’s output. You can examine output after a program finishes running, and you can share the output files with others as well. You can also write programs that read the text back into memory and work with it again later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing to an Empty File\n",
    "\n",
    "To write text to a file, you need to call `open()` with a second argument telling Python that you want to write to the file. To see how this works, let’s write a simple message and store it in a file instead of printing it to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call to `open()` in the following example has two arguments. The first argument is still the name of the file we want to open. The second argument, `'w'`, tells the Python interpreter, that we want to open the file in write mode. You can open a file in *read mode* (`'r'`), *write mode* (`'w'`), *append mode* (`'a'`), or a mode that allows you to *read and write* to the file (`'r+'`). If you omit the mode argument, Python opens the file in read-only mode by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `open()` function automatically creates the file you are writing to if it does not already exist. However, be careful opening a file in write mode (`'w'`) because if the file does exist, Python will erase the file before returning the file object."

    "For example, here are two lines of population data from Copenhagen data in CSV format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "2015,1,0,5100,614\n",
    "2015,1,0,5104,2\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is population data is from Copenhagen City with respect to year 2015. It includes the year of reference (2015 in first row), a code for the neighborhood of the city, the age of the corresponding citizens, a code of their nationality, and finally the amount of persons of that nationality and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is described in more detail here: http://data.kk.dk/dataset/befolkningen-efter-ar-bydel-alder-og-statsborgerskab\n",

    "A Writer object lets you write data to a CSV file. To create a Writer object, you use the csv.writer() function. Enter the following into the interactive shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, call `open()` and pass it `'w'` to open a file in write mode. This will create the object you can then pass to `csv.writer()` to create a Writer object.\n",

    "On Windows, you’ll also need to pass a blank string for the `open()` function’s newline keyword argument. For technical reasons beyond the scope of this book, if you forget to set the newline argument, the rows in `output.csv` will be double-spaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `writerow()` method for Writer objects takes a list argument. Each value in the list is placed in its own cell in the output CSV file. The return value of `writerow()` is the number of characters written to the file for that row (including newline characters). Notice how the Writer object automatically escapes the comma in the value `'614,5'` with double quotes in the CSV file. The `csv` module saves you from having to handle these special cases yourself."
